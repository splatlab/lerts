This directory contains results from running the C++ implementation of
the benchmark analytics at a rate slow enough to induce no dropped
packets.  These results are thus the "correct" answers for a
benchmark, and can be used to judge the accuracy of other versions of
the anayltic or other runs where packets may be dropped.

Each file has a name of the form analytic.benchN.P.

N = the number of the benchmark, e.g. 1,2,3
P = the number of packets generated and processed, e.g. 10K or 1M

The file content is what the C++ analytic writes to the screen as
it processes the packets and summarizes the results.
