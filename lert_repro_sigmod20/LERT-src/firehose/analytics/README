This directory contains code for several stream analytics, as discussed
in doc/analytics.html.

anomaly1 = anomaly detection in a fixed key range
anomaly2 = anomaly detection in an unbounded key range
anomaly3 = anomaly detection in a two-level key space

Each directory contains several implementations of the analytic
including single-file serial codes, implementations for different
streaming frameworks, and implementations in different languages.
